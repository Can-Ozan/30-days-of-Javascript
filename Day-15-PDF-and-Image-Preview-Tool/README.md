- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Core functionality and event handling
- **PDF.js**: Mozilla's PDF rendering library for client-side PDF processing

### Browser Compatibility

- Chrome 76+
- Firefox 70+
- Safari 13+
- Edge 79+

### Key JavaScript APIs

- **Drag-and-Drop API**: Handles `dragover`, `dragleave`, and `drop` events
- **File API**: Uses `FileReader` to read file contents
- **Canvas API**: Renders PDF pages to canvas elements

## üîß Customization

### Supported File Types

You can modify the accepted file types by editing the `accept` attribute in the HTML:

```html
<input type="file" id="fileInput" accept=".pdf,.jpg,.jpeg,.png,.gif,.bmp,.webp" hidden>
```

### Styling

The application uses CSS custom properties that can be easily modified:

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #3498db;
    --secondary-color: #2c3e50;
    --background-color: #f5f7fa;
}
```

### PDF Rendering Quality

Adjust the PDF rendering scale in the JavaScript:

```javascript
const scale = 1.5; // Increase for higher quality, decrease for better performance
```

## üì¶ Dependencies

- **PDF.js v3.4.120**: Loaded from CDN for PDF rendering capabilities
  - Main library: `https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/pdf.js/3.4.120/pdf.min.js`
  - Worker: `https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/pdf.js/3.4.120/pdf.worker.min.js`

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **PDF not loading**
   - Check internet connection (PDF.js requires network for worker)
   - Ensure PDF file is not corrupted or password protected

2. **Drag and drop not working**
   - Verify browser supports HTML5 Drag and Drop API
   - Check browser security settings

3. **Large files not loading**
   - The application handles files in memory, very large files may cause performance issues

### Error Handling

- Unsupported file types show an alert message
- PDF loading errors are caught and displayed to the user
- File reading errors are handled gracefully

## üåê Deployment

### Local Development
Simply open `index.html` in a web browser.
